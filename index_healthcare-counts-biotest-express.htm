<h1 style="margin-top:35px;">WHY HEALTHCARE COUNTS ON BIO-TEST EXPRESS…</h1>
<h2><a name="p1" id="p1"></a>Safe, Accurate, On-Time Service</h2>
<p>With each pickup and delivery, <strong>Bio-Test <em>Express</em></strong> couriers solidify the trust that medical technicians have placed in us since 1981. It’s a trust built through the understanding that we must continually back up our promise: to be the best, most comprehensive Courier Company serving the healthcare industry. And, to accomplish this, we adhere to time-tested protocols that guarantee success at every stop. What defines our success...? The precise components you request, carefully protected for sterility, received and delivered on or ahead of schedule.<em><strong> Every time…without fail.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:right; font-style:italic;"><a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /></a> <a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm" style="border-bottom:1px solid #000;">Top</a></p>
<img src="images/clock.jpg" alt="clock" style="float:left; margin-top:12px; margin-right:30px; margin-left:30px;" /><h2><a name="p2" id="p2"></a>Record Time</h2>
<p>Healthcare also turns to <strong>Bio-Test</strong> for point-to-point punctuality in transporting all types of medical records...blood test results, x-rays, and patient histories...also, pharmaceuticals and home infusion products. If you need it moved, trust <strong>Bio-Test</strong>. We'll respond with our prevailing professionalism, care for safety and confidentiality, and timely turnaround.</p>
<p style="text-align:right; font-style:italic;"><a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /></a> <a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm" style="border-bottom:1px solid #000;">Top</a></p>
<h2><a name="p3" id="p3"></a>24/365 Operation</h2>
<p>Our normal hours of operation are 7 am to 5 pm, which fits the standard business day. But, while doctors may keep office hours, emergencies don’t. For the dedicated medical professionals that are on-call, on-duty, and ready at a moment’s notice, <strong>Bio-Test <em>Express</em></strong> is equally vigilant. For those times outside the norm, a direct dial number reaches our 24/7 service, where specific Dispatchers and Couriers are scheduled to ensure a continual presence that our clients can count on. Whether providing back-up staffing, vehicle support, or management input, we’re always ready...unwinking in the wee hours; and prepared to handle the busiest of afternoons. </p>
<p style="text-align:right; font-style:italic;"><a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /></a> <a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm" style="border-bottom:1px solid #000;">Top</a></p>
<h2><a name="p4" id="p4"></a>A Professional Workforce</h2>
<p>Our Couriers carry with them the Company’s reputation. You’ll immediately find they conduct themselves with the same professionalism exhibited by you, our clients. Courteous, knowledgeable, and empowered to go the extra mile (so to speak) to make sure your every requirement is resolved. And you’ll always find them cleanly and uniformed—clearly identified as <strong>Bio-Test <em>Express</em></strong> Couriers—so there’s no concern when they enter your facility.</p>
<h3><a name="p5" id="p5"></a>EMPLOYEE SCREENING & TRAINING</h3>
<p style="margin-left:50px;">Our mission is to make tangible the difference that a singular-focused, employee-based organization makes in the management of blood and bio-hazardous materials...because it’s more than just a simple delivery. Therefore, our employees pass a number of checks before starting with the Company...including a review of their physical and driving history. And, before ever turning over the ignition, they receive a full orientation regarding the special precautions and procedures required for safe handling and transport—receiving proper certification only after passing a strict exam.</p>
<h3><a name="p6" id="p6"></a>CONTINUING EDUCATION</h3>
<p style="margin-left:50px;">As a pioneer in service to laboratory and transfusion medicine, <strong>Bio-Test <em>Express</em></strong> draws on decades of experience which have defined the protocols to which our Couriers adhere—standards that have always been set to exceed current regulations. However, the roster of codes is ever-changing, and <strong>Bio-Test’s</strong> management is particularly adept at anticipating new edicts from Federal and State governments. Thus, our Couriers are trained and tested on OSHA requirements every year&#8212;regardless of tenure. </p> 
<p style="text-align:right; font-style:italic;"><a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /></a> <a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm" style="border-bottom:1px solid #000;">Top</a></p> 
<h2><a name="p7" id="p7"></a>Equipment &amp; Safety</h2>
<ul style="margin-top:0;">
<li><strong>Bio-Test</strong> has a variety of vehicles to meet our customers’ demands...from PT Cruisers and minivans, to Ford cargo vans and 16-foot straight trucks. All are Company-owned and maintained, and clearly marked with the <strong>Bio-Test</strong> logo.</li>
<li>Every vehicle is equipped with a standard Spill Kit, in the event that a Courier needs to contain a spill or leak of biohazardous material.</li><img src="images/nextel.jpg" alt="Nextel Communication Systems" style="float:right; margin-left:20px; margin-top:-25px;" />
<li>At the start of their shift, <strong>Bio-Test</strong> drivers are issued a Nextel two-way communication system with cell phone capabilities.</li>
<li>Depending on the customer’s requirements, <strong>Bio-Test</strong> has a system of bar-coding and electronic scanning of delivery items, to provide real-time tracking.</li>
<li>All Couriers carry customized <strong>Bio-Test</strong> specimen transport systems. <img src="images/lock-box.jpg" alt="Bio-Test Express Lock Box" style="float:right; margin-top:25px; margin-right:10px; " />By using proper combinations of cold packs and dry ice, we’re able to ensure that the proper temperature of the specimen is maintained for the duration of the delivery.</li>
<li>When necessary, <strong>Bio-Test</strong> supplies metal Lock Boxes for the client to place outside their office. Our Couriers can then pick up specimens after their offices have closed for the day.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="p8" id="p8"></a>Account Management</h2>
<p>Total Customer Satisfaction is the ultimate goal. Yet, with over-the-road, point-to-point deliveries, obstacles are an everyday reality. To ensure our clients’ confidence in us, we have, in place, time-tested account management standards and procedures for the resolution of complaints and unforeseen problems.</p>
<p>A Customer Service Representative is assigned to each account, and he/she is their clients’ first contact on any issue that needs addressed. Among those issues are:</p>
<ul style="font-style:italic;  _margin-right:10px;">
<li><strong><a name="p9" id="p9"></a>Problem Resolution.</strong> The CSR is empowered to address customer complaints, and is required to report to Senior Management, who will follow up with the client to make certain of their satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong><a name="p10" id="p10"></a>Route Management.</strong> Routes are planned for daily, weekly, and monthly requirements. Using information provided by our clients, along with experience and detailed study, we ensure our Couriers follow the most efficient, cost-effective routes possible. STATs are received and dispatched by <strong>Bio-Test’s</strong> in-house call center. All STATs are given control numbers that correspond to a timed requirement of two-hour delivery from the receipt of the call. Signature confirmation is required at both pick-up points and delivery destinations, mandated for both regulatory and control purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:right; font-style:italic;"><a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /></a> <a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm" style="border-bottom:1px solid #000;">Top</a></p>
<h2><a name="p11" id="p11"></a>Liability Exposure</h2>
<p><strong>Bio-Test <em>Express</em></strong> provides insurance protection up to $5 million per occurrence. This measure is taken to afford our customers complete protection against all claims and possible liable suits. The amount set by our insurance carrier far exceeds the minimum required by law and speaks directly to the attention to detail that <strong>Bio-Test</strong> gives to every facet of the business.</p>
<p>Our insurance carrier conducts on-site audits to verify that every area of concern, be it employee hiring, maintenance of equipment, or employee safety, is conducted with the objective of upholding the highest standards.</p> 
<p style="text-align:right; font-style:italic;"><a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /></a> <a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm" style="border-bottom:1px solid #000;">Top</a></p>
<h2><a name="p12" id="p12"></a>Transportation Permits & Licensing</h2>
<p>Each <strong>Bio-Test <em>Express</em></strong> vehicle is properly marked with its PUC License Number and place of origin. Correct licensing and identification are required for all companies that serve the public via transportation of goods/people. <strong>Bio-Test</strong> also retains licenses from the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>
<p style="text-align:right; font-style:italic;"><a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm"><img src="images/top.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /></a> <a href="healthcare-counts-biotest-express.htm" style="border-bottom:1px solid #000;">Top</a></p>
<h2><a name="p13" id="p13"></a>Accreditation Compliance</h2>
<p>Because of our manufacturing expertise, <strong>Bio-Test</strong> is licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, the Food &amp; Drug Administration, and the United States Department of Health. These licenses allow us to anticipate changes and keep up&#8212;with expert knowledge of the current and future requirements of every associated organization.</p>
